# UI/UX Onboarding – Experience Design Setup

1. Is this experience primarily mobile, desktop, or hybrid?
2. Is the core user journey a single daily action, or multiple feature interactions?
3. What is the emotional tone or atmosphere we want users to feel inside the product? (e.g., calm, powerful, playful)
4. Do you need users to register immediately, or allow guest mode / pre-auth onboarding?
5. What is the first visual or message a user should see after launch?

Once answered, Floe will begin sketching the onboarding flow and preparing Figma or wireframe export.
